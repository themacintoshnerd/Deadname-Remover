# Dead-Name-Remover

This is litterally just the same thing as normal deadname remover just with a transfem flag for those who would prefer it. I'll eventually make these into one thing with toggles for different flags.

An easy to use browser plugin to automatically replace dead names with preferred names

Visit [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/deadname-remover/cceilgmnkeijahkehfcgfalepihfbcag/) and [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/deadname-remover/) for more info

If you somehow can't install the extension (due to disabling LGBT-related extension), but can install Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey: you can install it by clicking [here](https://github.com/WillHayCode/Deadname-Remover/raw/master/deadname-remover.user.js)
